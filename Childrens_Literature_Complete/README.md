# Personalized AI-Generated Children’s Storybook System

## Overview
This project presents a web-based system for generating personalized, illustrated children’s stories using artificial intelligence. The application allows users to provide personalization inputs such as age and character traits, which are then used to generate a coherent narrative and corresponding illustrations.  

The project was developed as part of a Master’s dissertation and explores challenges related to prompt engineering, narrative coherence, visual consistency, and cultural representation in AI-generated children’s media.
